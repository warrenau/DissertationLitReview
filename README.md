# DissertationLitReview
Literature review for my PhD dissertation.


## Overview
Sources are contained in the *LitReview* subfolder, along with the *`.bib`* file. The sources are split into three categories: those relating to hybrid simulation as combining two different computional methods (*Computation-Computation*); those relating to hybrid simulation as combining computation and experiment (*Computation-Experiment*); and those relating to digital twins (*DigitalTwin*). The sources in the second category are the most applicable to my research, but there is still some wisdom to be gained in the others.

## Findings

### Terms
Through reading the sources, I have found a list of terms that may provide more information when used in searches:
- Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS)
- real-time dynamic substructuring
- co-simulation
- model-based system testing
- cyber-physical empirical method
- hardware-in-the-loop

### Software
- Simulink real time stuff seems to be the most common (or the predecessor)

### Hardware

- Speedgoat (Simulink real time?)
- SCRAMNet (Shared Common Random Access Memory Network)(shared memory / distributed computing)
- Compensators ? (for signals)

## Papers of Interest
- The papers on compensation seem like they would be useful to look at as the set up comes together more, but I cannot really understand all of the nuance at the moment
- The teaching paper had a lot of good insight and a great intro/background on the state of hybrid simulation at the time of writing
- The distributed RTHS paper was very interesting for the large scale application of RTHS
- The historical and purpose/benefits papers referring to computional only hybrid simulation provided some context and theory that was good to read.
- The Shake table paper is very thourough with a lot of diagrams, but also a lot of math and matrix equations.
