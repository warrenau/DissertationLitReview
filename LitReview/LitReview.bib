  abstract  = {Though often overlooked, the impact of seismic transient ground deformation on natural gas (NG) pipes can be highly adverse. Particularly, pipe elbows may undergo excessive in-plane bending demand and buckling. In this paper, a critical scenario of a pipe coupling two industrial structures typically found in an NG processing plant is studied. High strain and cross-sectional ovalization on the elbows are probable during an earthquake due to the out-of-phase oscillation of the two structures imposing asynchronous displacement demands at the two pipe ends. A parametric study was first performed to investigate various structure-pipe-structure configurations that increase seismic demands to pipe elbows. Simultaneous mobilization of divergent oscillation between two supporting structures at the low-frequency range, a lower pipe-structure stiffness ratio, a shorter length of straight pipe segments in the linking pipe element, and a higher pipe internal pressure have led to the onset of critical strain demands in pipe elbows. To validate this observation, an experimental campaign was developed in which a full-scale linking pipe element was physically tested by means of hybrid simulation (HS). The study shows that the seismic interaction of the structures coupled with the pipe is nonnegligible and can even be critical for the integrity of the coupling pipe. The finding depends on the structural system's dynamic and geometrical properties as well the frequency content of the earthquake excitation.},

  abstract  = {Hybrid simulation combines numerical simulation and physical testing, and is thus considered to be an efficient alternative to traditional testing methodologies in the evaluation of global performance of large or complex structures. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is performed when it is important to fully capture rate-dependent behaviors in the physical substructure. Although the demand to test more complex systems grows, not every laboratory has the right combination of computational and equipment resources available to perform largescale experiments. Distributed real-time hybrid simulation (dRTHS) facilitates testing that is to be conducted at multiple geographically distributed laboratories while utilizing the Internet to couple the substructures. One major challenge in dRTHS is to accommodate the unpredictable communication time delays between the various distributed sites that occur as a result of Internet congestion. Herein, a dRTHS framework is proposed where a modified Smith predictor is adopted to accommodate such communication delays. To examine and demonstrate the sensitivity of the proposed framework to communication delays and to modeling errors, parametric analytical case studies are presented. Additionally, the effectiveness of this dRTHS framework is verified through successful execution of multisite experiments. The results demonstrate that this framework provides a new option for researchers to evaluate the global response of structural systems in a distributed real-time environment.},

The stability, overshoot, and numerical damping characteristics of the proposed algorithms are studied. It is shown that certain algorithms have unconditional stability for linear and softening nonlinear structures. The overshoot phenomenon is small, where the displacement is one power of the time step due to the initial velocity, whereas the velocity does not. The amount of numerical damping is adjusted by a single parameter to control the divergence of false higher-order modes. The analysis of RTHS was performed on a multiple degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structure and complex buildingdamper structure to verify the theoretical analysis. The comparison with two typical algorithms of the explicit Newmark and Gui-λ demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in improving stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, which can be applied to complex RTHS.},

In this approach, well-understood components of the structure are modeled numerically, while the components of interest are tested physically. Generally, an arbitrary amount of time may be used to calculate and apply displacements at each step of the hybrid simulation. However, when the rate-dependent behavior of the physical specimen is important, real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) must be used. Computation, communication, and servohydraulic actuator limitations cause delays and lags that lead to inaccuracies and potential instabilities in RTHS. This paper proposes a new model-based servohydraulic tracking control method including feedforward-feedback links to achieve accurate tracking of a desired displacement in real time. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through RTHS for a single-degree-of-freedom system and a 9-story steel building, each using a 200-kN large-scale magnetorheological damper as the rate-dependent physical specimen.},

This paper presents the basic approach of the method, describing the numerical and experimental techniques. Based on current studies, the capabilities and limitations of the method are examined, and possible improvement methods are mentioned. In spite of certain numerical and experimental errors, recent verification tests show that the method can be as reliable and realistic as shaking table testing and that it can be readily implemented in many structural laboratories. The capabilities of the method can be further expanded to test specimens under various load and structural boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Real-time dynamic substructuring is an experimental technique for testing the dynamic behaviour of complex structures. It involves creating a hybrid model of the entire structure by combining an experimental test piece—the substructure—with a numerical model describing the remainder of the system. The technique is useful when it is impractical to experimentally test the entire structure or complete numerical modelling is insufficient. In this paper, we focus on the influence of delay in the system, which is generally due to the inherent dynamics of the transfer systems (actuators) used for structural testing. This naturally gives rise to a delay differential equation (DDE) model of the substructured system. With the case of a substructured system consisting of a single mass–spring oscillator we demonstrate how a DDE model can be used to understand the influence of the response delay of the actuator. Specifically, we describe a number of methods for identifying the critical time delay above which the system becomes unstable. Because of the low damping in many large structures a typical situation is that a substructuring test would operate in an unstable region if additional techniques were not implemented in practice. We demonstrate with an adaptive delay compensation technique that the substructured mass–spring oscillator system can be stabilized successfully in an experiment. The approach of DDE modelling also allows us to determine the dependence of the critical delay on the parameters of the delay compensation scheme. Using this approach we develop an over-compensation scheme that will help ensure stable experimental testing from initiation to steady state operation. This technique is particularly suited to stiff structures or those with very low natural damping as regularly encountered in structural engineering. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Hybrid simulation results have been shown to be reliable by comparison to shake-table simulations when propagation of experimental errors is successfully mitigated. Techniques have been proposed to assess the severity of experimental errors prior to or after tests have been completed. In this paper, an error monitoring method is presented that predicts the reliability of the test results in real time using data that is readily available. Two error monitors are derived based on estimates of energy added to the hybrid simulation as a result of errors in the experimental setup. The proposed method can provide valuable decision-making information by generating early warnings of unacceptable levels of experimental errors. The warning signals can serve as an indicator to pause the simulation, examine the source of error, and correct the problem, preferably before the specimen is irreparably damaged. Use of the proposed hybrid simulation error monitors to provide a measure of confidence of the quality of the test results is verified in two hybrid simulations.},

  abstract  = {Experimental modal analysis is commonly associated with the use of simulation models for validation, correlation and model updating. However, this interaction between simulation and test is constantly evolving, not in the least because it can be applied to model-based design engineering in the broad sense. Over time, new simulation methods have emerged and consequently, new approaches combining experimental and numerical methodologies are needed and possible. Model Based System Testing (MBST) is an innovative paradigm that allows to structure this process and, in particular, to investigate how the well-established modal testing and analysis procedures and ways of working can be adopted to the multiphysical nature of mechatronic systems. As a result, many possibilities arise: test data can be used to validate multiphysical models, models help gaining insights into test conditions, hybrid approaches allow combining testing and simulation on hardware-in-the-loop and system-in-the-loop test benches, where physical systems can be combined with simulation models to apply loads and more realistic test conditions, as well as the use of data coming from feedback control system information for testing purposes. In this paper, the context and concepts of MBST will be introduced, and application examples will be shown, highlighting the advantages of such a methodology.},

  abstract = {High burn-up, rim structures within uranium dioxide (UO2) light water reactor fuels exhibit marked differences in microstructure that are attributed to dynamic recrystallization. The recrystallization process has three distinct, interacting components: damage accumulation, nucleation and growth of damage-free regions, and subsequent evolution of recrystallized grains. In this paper, microstructural-scale simulation techniques for all three processes are presented and assembled into a hybrid tool for modeling the entire dynamic recrystallization process. The components of the model include a phenomenological model for damage accumulation and nucleation, a Cellular Automaton (CA) model for the growth and impingement of recrystallized grains, and a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) Potts model for subsequent grain growth. Preliminary results of the hybrid model demonstrate the evolution of a steady state grain size. Parametric simulations show the dependence of the steady state grain size on physical variables and on system size.},

  abstract  = {Hybrid reactor simulation (HRS) of boiling water reactor (BWR) instabilities, including in-phase and out-of-phase (OOP) oscillations, has been implemented on The Pennsylvania State University TRIGA reactor. The TRIGA reactor's power response is used to simulate reactor neutron dynamics for in-phase oscillation or the fundamental mode of the reactor modal kinetics for OOP oscillations. The reactor power signal drives a real-time boiling channel simulation, and the calculated reactivity feedback is in turn fed into the TRIGA reactor via an experimental changeable reactivity device. The thermal-hydraulic dynamics, together with first harmonic mode power dynamics, is digitally simulated in the real-time environment. The real-time digital simulation of boiling channel thermal hydraulics is performed by solving constitutive equations for different regions in the channel and is realized by a high-performance personal computer. The nonlinearity of the thermal-hydraulic model ensures the capability to simulate the oscillation phenomena, limit cycle and OOP oscillation, in BWR nuclear power plants. By adjusting reactivity feedback gains for both modes, various oscillation combinations can be realized in the experiment. The dynamics of axially lumped power distribution over the core is displayed in three-dimensional graphs. The HRS reactor power response mimics the BWR core-wide power stability phenomena. In the OOP oscillation HRS, the combination of reactor response and the simulated first harmonic power using shaping functions mimics BWR regional power oscillations. With this HRS testbed, a monitoring and/or control system designed for BWR power oscillations can be experimentally tested and verified.},

  abstract = {CABRI is an experimental pulse reactor, funded by the french Institute for Radiological protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) and operated by CEA at the Cadarache nuclear center, France. Its aim is to study and thus to better understand RIA (Reactivity-Initiated Accident) effects on nuclear fuels. The restart of the CABRI reactor in 2015 offers the opportunity to validate tools involving multiphysic calculation schemes on reactivity insertions (RI) transients at a system scale. Physics of the in-pile CABRI tests is complex and implies various physical fields (solid and fluid thermics, thermal-hydraulics, mechanics and neutronics) and their coupled effects. The reactivity insertion in CABRI is mastered by the depressurization of a neutron absorber (3He), contained into transient rods. The increase of the neutron flux inside the core induces the neutronic power increase inside the core and a multiphysic effect, called “TOP” effect, inside the in-core transient rods that causes an acceleration of the gas depressurization. The challenge is thus to manage the simulation of these RIA complex transients catching the governing multiphysical phenomena to be identified. In order to achieve this objective, a model for the CABRI transients and a scientific calculation tool have been developed and should be validated. This paper proposes a modeling of governing multiphysic phenomena of RIA transients in CABRI reactor based on a Quantified Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table (QPIRT). These models are introduced in the CATHARE2 tool in a dedicated version named PALANTIR and Best-Estimate simulation results are compared with experimental data obtained on CABRI commission tests: core power and 3He pressure evolution.},

  abstract = {Traditional nuclear fuel performance codes usually employ the operator split methods for multiphysics coupling and the quasi-two-dimensional approach (1.5D approach) for geometry modelling. However, the multiphysics behavior of the fuel element is often tightly coupled, and there exist some kinds of non-axisymmetric fuel elements in reactors. In this paper, a new fuel performance code named NECP-CALF has been developed based on the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). It solves the multiphysics coupled equations using the JFNK method. A new geometrical approach called mixed dimensional approach is implemented in the new code, which allows users to model fuel elements with more flexibility. A UO2-Zr fuel rod is simulated and the results are compared with BISON and CAMPUS to establish the proof-of-concept of this code. Then a small-scale UO2-Zr fuel rod with azimuthally asymmetric cladding temperature is designed and simulated with the mixed dimensional approach to verify the accuracy and demonstrate the performance. Finally, the code is applied to the fuel performance simulation of a supercritical water-cooled fuel rod with flow blockage, and the results show the impact of the flow blockage on the fuel rod performance.},

The restart of the CABRI reactor in 2015 offers the opportunity to validate tools involving multiphysic calculation schemes on reactivity insertions (RI) transients at a system scale. The reactivity insertion in CABRI is mastered by the depressurization of a neutron absorber (3He), contained into transient rods. This enables the realization of various types of transients. As this depressurization highly influences the reactivity insertion kinetics, it is essential to accurately simulate the 3He density evolution which depends on the heat exchanges inside the circuit. The challenge is thus to manage the simulation of the various CABRI complex transients. Previous work allowed to model with CATHARE2 the whole reactor with its specific phenomena as well as phenomena generally involved in RIA, for instance strong neutronic feedback effects, effect of the pellet-clad interaction on the gap conductance and transient heat exchanges between fuel rods and water. These studies also revealed that some CABRI transients were still difficult to model with CATHARE2 and this paper shows the necessity to catch the transient heat exchanges in the transients rods for the simulation of the power pulse in CABRI reactor. In order to achieve this objective, a correlation for the Nusselt evolution in an unsteady compressible laminar 3He flow, inside a closed tube, has been realized from numerical resolution of an analytical model and implemented in the scientific calculation tool CATHARE2. This paper describes this analytical model and its numerical resolution. After having been validated on results of the literature in steady flow inside open tube, the correlation established for the evolution of the Nusselt in a transient rods’ tube is given. Finally, Best-Estimate simulation results of CATHARE2 are compared with experimental data obtained on CABRI commission tests: core power and 3He pressure evolution.},

  abstract = {The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) is a nuclear reactor concept under development in the framework of the H2020-Euratom project SAMOSAFER. Given its peculiar characteristics as a circulating-fuel reactor, new simulation tools need to be developed and tested for its study. In this work, a multiphysics solver previously developed in OpenFOAM is extended with new functionalities for the analysis of this reactor design. The main focus is the modelling of the behavior of Gaseous Fission Products (GFPs) inside the core and their interactions with a helium bubbling system, foreseen to remove both GFPs and metallic fission products through flotation. On the basis of an Euler-Euler solver able to model the presence of the two phases – namely the liquid fuel and the gaseous bubbles – , a multi-component mixture approach is adopted to simulate the behavior of GFP species in the core, with particular focus on their production, consumption, transport, mass exchange and removal to the off-gas system. The new capabilities are tested on both 2D and 3D MSFR cases, considering Xe-135 as reference nuclide, with focus on the efficiency of the bubbling system in the removal of GFPs from the salt. As main figure of merit of the removal capability, a cycle time related to the extraction of the specie from the system is defined and calculated for different conditions of helium injection. This work constitutes a further advancement in the development of the MSFR concept, extending the modelling capabilities of the previous multiphysics solver. Reliable estimation of the evolution of the gaseous fission products in the reactor core and the related effect of the helium bubbling system is a fundamental requirement for the analysis of the radioactive source term and for the prediction of the overall operating conditions of this innovative nuclear system.},

  abstract = {With the recent development of advanced numerical algorithms, software design, and low-cost high-performance computer hardware, reliance on coupled multiphysics to predict the behavior of complex physical systems is beginning to become standard practice. This is especially true in nuclear energy applications where strong nonlinear interdependencies exist between reactor physics, radiation transport, multi-scale nuclear fuels performance, thermal fluids, etc. Resolving these nonlinear dependencies requires choices in multiphysics software approaches. Two main multiphysics modeling and simulation approaches have emerged. The first is based upon “code coupling” where disparate physics codes of different software design, code languages, and spatial and temporal integration schemes are coupled together with relatively complex data passing interfaces. The second multiphysics software approach is to employ a “cohesive” framework where all physics applications are developed with a common software design, i.e., data structures, syntax, input format, integrated spatial and temporal discretization schemes, etc. Here we present the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) development and runtime framework and describe the framework’s cohesive modeling and simulation multiphysics approach. Then, a “cohesive-like” extension of the MOOSE framework is presented where MOOSE-based physics software applications are efficiently coupled to non-MOOSE (external) physics codes to form multiphysics applications using MOOSE’s unique interface capabilities. Finally, several examples of MOOSE’s cohesive and cohesive-like multiphysics applications will be demonstrated. These multiphysics demonstrations will incorporate both MOOSE-based applications and external codes, including Nek5000, RELAP-7, TRACE, BISON, and Pronghorn.},

  abstract = {The analysis of innovative reactor concepts such as the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) requires the development of new modeling and simulation tools. In the case of the MSFR, the strong intrinsic coupling between thermal–hydraulics, neutronics and fuel chemistry has lead to the adoption of the multiphysics approach as a state-of-the-art paradigm. One of the peculiar aspects of liquid-fuel reactors such as the MSFR is the mobility of fission products (FPs) in the reactor circuit. Some FP species appear in form of solid precipitates carried by the fuel flow and can deposit on reactor boundaries (e.g., heat exchangers), potentially representing design issues related to the degradation of heat exchange performance or radioactive hotspots. Other precipitates might be present in the primary system as well, e.g. due to oxidation of fissile species which might lead to local criticality issues. The integration of transport models for solid particles in multiphysics codes is therefore relevant for the prediction of deposited fractions. To this aim, a previously developed Eulerian single-phase transport model is employed to analyze the distribution of solid FPs in two simplified MSFR-related geometries. The effect of physical parameters and of distributed particle sources on the numerical requirements needed to resolve particle concentration gradients at reactor boundaries in the considered geometries is investigated with the aid of analytical results. Analytical estimates of concentration gradients, even though not in full agreement with simulations, prove useful to drive the choice of adequate mesh refinements. Furthermore, the influence of different RANS turbulence modeling approaches on the prediction of particle distributions and deposition is tested. Results show a limited influence of the choice of turbulence models and parameters on the deposited fraction and on concentration gradients. As a result, it is found that deposition rates are scarcely affected by the choice of turbulent Schmidt number, with lower diffusivities being compensated by larger gradients. Large deposited fractions are indeed predicted, suggesting the efficiency of FPs transport mechanisms in the reactor and the need for the integration of adequate FPs transport models within state-of-the-art MSFR codes.},

  abstract = {In the field of reactor physics analysis, the coupling of multiple physics phenomena plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of predictions and understanding complex systems. Multiphysics refers to the study and analysis of physical phenomena that involve multiple interconnected physical processes occurring simultaneously in a nuclear system to ensure essential aspects of reactor design, safety analysis, and optimization, among others. Multiphysics encompasses various domains of physics, such as Thermal-Hydraulics, Neutronics, Structural Mechanics, Radiation Transport, Chemistry, and Materials Science. On the other hand, the Multiscale approach involves combining high-fidelity models with lower-fidelity ones to accurately capture the relevant physical phenomena in a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). Multiscale involves three main scales: system level, core level, and detailed analysis scale. This paper presents an overview of the main research performed by Spanish groups in the field of multiphysics and multiscale calculations, particularly on thermal–hydraulic analysis. This revision is focused mainly on two key aspects: thermal–hydraulic multiscale coupling and thermal–hydraulic / neutronic coupling. The paper also includes the expected future trends in this field.},

A good agreement is found comparing the critical boron concentration and a set of pin-level neutron flux profiles against measurements. In addition, the calculated axial and radial power distributions match closely the values reported by the core monitoring system. To demonstrate the modeling capabilities of the three-code coupling, pin-level neutronic, thermalhydraulic and thermomechanic results are shown as well.

  abstract = {A Multiphysics coupling framework, MPCORE, has been developed to analyze safety parameters using the best estimate codes. The framework contains neutron kinetics (NK), thermal hydraulics (TH), and fuel performance (FP) codes to analyze fuel burnup, radial power distribution, and coolant temperature (Tbc). Shuffling and rotation capabilities have been verified on the Watts Bar reactor for three cycles. This study focuses on two coupling approaches for TH and FP modules. The one-way coupling approach involves coupling the FP code with the NK code, providing no data to the TH modules but getting Tbc as boundary condition from TH module. The two-way coupling approach exchanges information from FP to TH modules, so that the simplified heat conduction solver of the TH module is not used. The power profile in both approaches does not differ significantly, but there is an impact on coolant and cladding parameters. The one-way coupling approach tends to over-predict the cladding hydrogen concentration (CHC). This research highlights the difference between one-way and two-way coupling on critical boron concentration, Tbc, CHC, oxide surface temperature, and pellet centerline temperature. Overall, MPCORE framework with two-way coupling provides a more accurate and reliable analysis of safety parameters for nuclear reactors.},

This code aims at providing an accurate yet fast core thermal-hydraulics solution capability to high-fidelity multiphysics core analysis systems targeting massively parallel computing platforms. The four equation drift-flux model is adopted for two-phase calculations, and numerical solutions are obtained by applying the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equation (SIMPLE)-like algorithm in a staggered grid system. Constitutive models involving turbulent mixing, pressure drop, and vapor generation are employed to simulate key phenomena in subchannel-scale analyses. ESCOT is parallelized by a domain decomposition scheme that involves both radial and axial decomposition to enable highly parallelized execution. The ESCOT solutions are validated through the applications to various experiments which include CNEN 4 × 4, Weiss et al. two assemblies, PNNL 2 × 6, RPI 2 × 2 air-water, and PSBT covering single/two-phase and unheated/heated conditions. The parameters of interest for validation include various flow characteristics such as turbulent mixing, spacer grid pressure drop, cross-flow, reverse flow, buoyancy effect, void drift, and bubble generation. For all the validation tests, ESCOT shows good agreements with measured data in the extent comparable to those of other subchannel-scale codes: COBRA-TF, MATRA and/or CUPID. The execution performance is examined with a mini-sized whole core consisting of 89 fuel assemblies and for an OPR1000 core. It turns out that it is about 1.5 times faster than a subchannel code based on the two-fluid three field model and the axial domain decomposition scheme works as well as the radial one yielding a steady-state solution for the OPR1000 core within 30 s with 104 processors.},

  abstract = {KANT (KAIST Advanced Nuclear Tachygraphy) is a PWR core simulator recently developed at Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology, which solves three-dimensional steady-state and transient multigroup neutron diffusion equations under Cartesian geometries alongside the incorporation of thermal-hydraulics feedback effect for multi-physics calculation. It utilizes the standard Nodal Expansion Method (NEM) accelerated with various Coarse Mesh Finite Difference (CMFD) methods for neutronics calculation. For thermal-hydraulics (TH) calculation, a single-phase flow model and a one-dimensional cylindrical fuel rod heat conduction model are employed. The time-dependent neutronics and TH calculations are numerically solved through an implicit Euler scheme, where a detailed coupling strategy is presented in this paper alongside a description of nodal equivalence, macroscopic depletion, and pin power reconstruction. For validation of the steady, transient, and depletion calculation with pin power reconstruction capacity of KANT, solutions for various benchmark problems are presented. The IAEA 3-D PWR and 4-group KOEBERG problems were considered for the steady-state reactor benchmark problem. For transient calculations, LMW (Lagenbuch, Maurer and Werner) LWR and NEACRP 3-D PWR benchmarks were solved, where the latter problem includes thermal-hydraulics feedback. For macroscopic depletion with pin power reconstruction, a small PWR problem modified with KAIST benchmark model was solved. For validation of the multi-physics analysis capability of KANT concerning large-sized PWRs, the BEAVRS Cycle1 benchmark has been considered. It was found that KANT solutions are accurate and consistent compared to other published works.},

  abstract = {Helical-coil steam generator (HCSG) technology is a major design candidate for small modular reactors due to its compactness and capability to produce superheated steam with high generation efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of the passively autonomous power maneuvering by coupling the 3-D transient multi-physics of a soluble-boron-free (SBF) core with a time-dependent HCSG model. The predictor corrector quasi-static method was used to reduce the cost of the transient 3-D neutronic solution. In the numerical system simulations, the feedwater flow rate to the secondary of the HCSGs is adjusted to extract the demanded power from the primary loop. This varies the coolant temperature at the inlet of the SBF core, which governs the passively autonomous power maneuvering due to the strongly negative coolant reactivity feedback. Here, we simulate a 100-50-100 load-follow operation with a 5%/minute power ramping speed to investigate the feasibility of the passively autonomous load-follow in a 450 MWth SBF PWR. In addition, the passively autonomous frequency control operation is investigated. The various system models are coupled, and they are solved by an in-house Fortran-95 code. The results of this work demonstrate constant steam temperature in the secondary side and limited variation of the primary coolant temperature. Meanwhile, the variations of the core axial shape index and the core power peaking are sufficiently small.},

  abstract = {An improved robust formulation for constituent distribution in metallic nuclear fuels is developed and implemented into the advanced fuel performance framework BISON. The coupled thermal diffusion equations are solved simultaneously to reanalyze the constituent redistribution in post irradiation data from fuel tests performed in Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). Deficiencies observed in previously published formulation and numerical implementations are also improved. The present model corrects an inconsistency between the enthalpies of solution and the solubility limit curves of the phase diagram while also adding an artificial diffusion term when in the 2-phase regime that stabilizes the standard Galerkin finite element (FE) method used by BISON. An additional improvement is in the formulation of zirconium flux as it relates to the Soret term. With these new modifications, phase dependent diffusion coefficients are revaluated and compared with the previously recommended values. The model validation included testing against experimental data from fuel pins T179, DP16 and T459, irradiated in EBR-II. A series of viable material properties for U–Pu–Zr based materials was determined through a sensitivity study, which resulted in three cases with differing parameters that showed strong agreement with one set of experimental data, rod T179. Subsequently a full-scale simulation of T179 was performed to reduce uncertainties, particularly relating to the temperature boundary condition for the fuel. In addition a new thermal conductivity model combining all available data covering 0–100% zirconium concentration and a zirconium concentration dependent linear heat rate solution derived from Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) simulations were developed. An iterative calibration process was applied to obtain optimized diffusion coefficients for U–Pu–Zr metallic fuels. Optimized diffusion coefficients suggest relative improvements in comparison to previous reported values. The most influential or uncertain phase is found to be the gamma phase, followed by alpha phase, and thirdly the beta phase; indicating separate effect testing should concentrate on these phases.},

  abstract = {The thermal, mechanical, and neutronic performance of the metal alloy fast reactor fuel design complements the safety advantages of the liquid metal cooling and the pool-type primary system. Together, these features provide large safety margins in both normal operating modes and for a wide range of postulated accidents. In particular, they maximize the measures of safety associated with inherent reactor response to unprotected, double-fault accidents, and to minimize risk to the public and plant investment. High thermal conductivity and high gap conductance play the most significant role in safety advantages of the metallic fuel, resulting in a flatter radial temperature profile within the pin and much lower normal operation and transient temperatures in comparison to oxide fuel. Despite the big difference in melting point, both oxide and metal fuels have a relatively similar margin to melting during postulated accidents. When the metal fuel cladding fails, it typically occurs below the coolant boiling point and the damaged fuel pins remain coolable. Metal fuel is compatible with sodium coolant, eliminating the potential of energetic fuel–coolant reactions and flow blockages. All these, and the low retained heat leading to a longer grace period for operator action, are significant contributing factors to the inherently benign response of metallic fuel to postulated accidents. This paper summarizes the past analytical and experimental results obtained in past sodium-cooled fast reactor safety programs in the United States, and presents an overview of fuel safety performance as observed in laboratory and in-pile tests.},

The verification of computational tools able to simulate the plant behaviour under postulated accidental conditions by code-to-code comparison was identified as a key point to ensure reactor safety. In this line, several organizations employed coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic system codes able to simulate complex and specific phenomena involving multi-physics studies adapted to this particular fast reactor technology. In the “Introduction” of this paper the framework of this study is discussed, the second section describes the envisaged plant design and the commonly agreed upon modelling guidelines.

In the first part of this paper the models of the ESFR design developed by several organisations in the framework of the CP-ESFR project were presented and their reliability validated via a benchmarking exercise. This second part of the paper includes the application of those tools for the analysis of design basis accident (DBC) scenarios of the reference design. Further, this paper also introduces the main features of the core optimisation process carried out within the project with the objective to enhance the core safety performance through the reduction of the positive coolant density reactivity effect. The influence of this optimised core design on the reactor safety performance during the previously analysed transients is also discussed. The conclusion provides an overview of the work performed by the partners involved in the project towards the development and enhancement of computational tools specifically tailored to the evaluation of the safety performance of the Generation IV innovative nuclear reactor designs.},

  abstract = {Metal fuel is being developed for the prototype generation-IV sodium-cooled fast reactor (PGSFR) to be built by 2028. U–Zr fuel is a driver for the initial core of the PGSFR, and U–transuranics (TRU)–Zr fuel will gradually replace U–Zr fuel through its qualification in the PGSFR. Based on the vast worldwide experiences of U–Zr fuel, work on U–Zr fuel is focused on fuel design, fabrication of fuel components, and fuel verification tests. U–TRU–Zr fuel uses TRU recovered through pyroelectrochemical processing of spent PWR (pressurized water reactor) fuels, which contains highly radioactive minor actinides and chemically active lanthanide or rare earth elements as carryover impurities. An advanced fuel slug casting system, which can prevent vaporization of volatile elements through a control of the atmospheric pressure of the casting chamber and also deal with chemically active lanthanide elements using protective coatings in the casting crucible, was developed. Fuel cladding of the ferritic–martensitic steel FC92, which has higher mechanical strength at a high temperature than conventional HT9 cladding, was developed and fabricated, and is being irradiated in the fast reactor.},

  abstract = {The demonstrated technological feasibility of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs) makes them stand out among the other reactor concepts proposed by Generation IV International Forum (GIF) for short-term deployment. The availability of reliable computational tools in support of safety analyses and plant simulations under complex transient scenarios is essential to assure SFR’s compliance with the highest safety goals. Answering this need, a multi-physics three-dimensional core and system model is being developed to enable a more detailed representation of the physics of the plant and to anticipate more accurately plant behaviour, even under wider three-dimensional scenarios, such as asymmetric transients. The coupling will be performed using the U.S.NRC system codes TRACE-PARCS, modified to simulate more accurately when using sodium as coolant. The publicly available end-of-life tests conducted in the French SFR Phenix were chosen as baseline to perform a first validation of the computational model. The development of the tool started with a three-dimensional thermal-hydraulic nodal system of Phenix using the TRACE system code. The system simulates the Phenix end-of-life natural circulation test and the result have been compared with published experimental and benchmark results. The main physical phenomena of the 3 phases of the transient (rise in temperature in the low part of the reactor vessel, establishment of natural convection and subsequent cooling of the lower and upper part of the vessel) are predicted by the developed nodal system. More specifically, the analysis of parameters such as Intermediate Heat Exchangers (IHX), primary pumps and core temperatures, shows that the developed system is able to predict and study natural convection phenomena in Phenix-type reactors. The three-dimensional nodal system is able to clearly illustrate the existing thermal stratification in the hot pool, which is neglected by one-dimensional systems and enables the modelling of thermal hydraulic asymmetric behaviour, as it is shown by the uneven flow distribution in Phenix’s primary IHXs as they are asymmetrically located in the reactor vessel.},

  abstract = {The concept of a graphite-moderating rod-inserted sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) fuel assembly is proposed in this study to achieve a low sodium void reactivity coefficient. Using this concept, two types of SFR cores are analyzed; the proposed SFR type 1 core has new SFR fuel assemblies at the inner/mid core regions while the proposed SFR type 2 core has a B4C absorber sandwich in the middle of the active core region as well as new SFR fuel assemblies at the inner/mid core regions. For the proposed SFR core designs, neutronics and thermal-hydraulic analyses are performed using the DIF3D, REBUS3, and the MATRA-LMR codes. In the neutronics analysis, the sodium void reactivity coefficient is obtained in various void situations. The two types of proposed core designs reduce the sodium void reactivity coefficient by about 960–1030pcm compared to the reference design. However, the TRU enrichment for the proposed SFR core designs is increased. In the thermal hydraulic analysis, the temperature distributions are calculated for the two types of proposed core designs and the mass flow rate is optimized to satisfy the design constraints for the highest power generating assembly. The results of this study indicate that the proposed SFR assembly design concept, which adopts graphite-moderating rods which are inserted into the fuel assembly, can feasibly minimize the sodium void reactivity coefficient. Single TRU enrichment and an identical fuel slug diameter throughout the SFR core are also achieved because the radial power peak can be flattened by varying the number of moderating rods in each core region.},

The development started at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland in 2017, with the aim to replace VTT’s outdated legacy codes used for the deterministic safety analyses of Finnish power reactors. In addition to conventional large PWRs and BWRs, Kraken is intended to be used for the modeling of SMRs and emerging non-LWR technologies. The main computational modules include the Serpent Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport code, the Ants nodal neutronics solver, the FINIX fuel behavior module and the Kharon thermal hydraulics code, all developed at VTT. The core physics solution can be further coupled to system-scale simulations. In addition to development, significant effort has been devoted to verification and validation of the implemented methodologies. The reduced-order Ants code has been successfully used for steady-state, transient and burnup simulations of PWRs with rectangular and hexagonal core geometry. The Ants–Kharon–FINIX code sequence is actively used for the core design tasks in VTT’s district heating reactor project. This paper is a general overview on the background, functional description, current status and future plans for the Kraken framework. Due to the short history of development, Kraken has not yet been comprehensively validated or applied to full-scale core physics calculations. A review of previous studies is instead provided to exemplify the practical use.},

  abstract = {The shipbuilding industry has placed an emphasis on establishing digital twin prototypes to advance computational lifecycle analysis capabilities. However, material processing data is not currently included in simulations for structural performance, which could lead to inaccuracies. Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) techniques yield a path to solving this problem through linking digital information across multiple length scales in order to minimize the time and cost of physical testing needed for validation. This paper details the initial work of a larger materials-informed digital twin effort seeking to validate the need for fabrication inclusion in lifecycle analysis. First, the selection and fabrication of the “sister sample” specimens used for physical validation from a single plate of HSLA-100 steel. Second, the finite-element analysis (FEA)-based welding simulations of the reinforced dog-bone weldment. Third, comparison of predicted strain data from FEA simulations to two-dimensional (2D) strain maps using energy dispersive diffraction (EDD) techniques at the Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The results showed high correlation between the measured EDD data and the FEA predictions, particularly for the high strain (>0.0015) fields of first principle strain vectors measured parallel to each welding pass. This computational validation is the first step towards validating the materials-informed digital twin method for increasing accuracy of structural analysis and fatigue lifecycle evaluation.},

Our research provides an open framework that can be linked to services such as visualizations, simulations and remote control.

The digital twin prototype illustrated the capability of mirroring and controlling the model’s position in real-time, and predicting motion responses across wave conditions via a web application. Thus, it closes the loop between test and design in the life cycle by allowing validation of results in comparison to empirical data during operation. The results from these experiments are used to discuss an expanded version of the digital twin for validation and optimization of motion response, as well as its implications to the system’s (ship) taxonomy and data management. The conclusion summarizes lessons when using the adopted standards, as well as challenges when scaling the approach to real life operations. Future research is proposed toward extending the standardization to more complex cases.},

If an unexpected fault occurs during the travel, the system should be able to manage that fault autonomously and continue its mission. Thus, a robust fault mitigation system is needed that can quickly reconfigure itself in an optimal way. This paper presents a novel digital twin-based fault mitigation strategy that uses hierarchical control architecture. Here, a computationally efficient high-fidelity hybrid engine model is developed to simulate actual engine behavior. This hybrid engine model includes a neural network model representing the cylinder combustion process and well-studied physics-based analytical equations describing the remaining subsystems. This architecture uses a feedback controller on top of the control calibration map, generated offline using the hybrid model, to mitigate faults and modeling errors. The fault mitigation strategies are calibrated and validated through model-in-loop (MIL) and hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulations for various operating points using the Navistar 7.6 liters six-cylinder engine. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture in handling injector nozzle clogging, intake manifold leaks, and pressure shift faults is illustrated. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can completely overcome faults and maintain the desired torque in a few seconds. Moreover, the average accuracy of 96% is observed for the engine model compared to experimental data. It is anticipated that the proposed end-to-end architecture will be easily deployable on unmanned marine vessels and can be extended to accommodate other component faults.},

Tokamak fusion is one of the solutions to the energy crisis. The environment of the vacuum chamber as a reaction site is extreme, so it needs to be observed during the operation period. This paper has developed a digital twin system for the snake endoscope manipulator (SEM) system, designed to observe of the fusion reactor vacuum chamber. The system includes a five-dimensional model of the SEM digital twin and a three-category architecture encompassing perception, data, and interaction. Additionally, a visualization and interaction system based on ROS-Unity has been developed to depict the working conditions of the SEM accurately. A terminal traction-based trajectory tracking control algorithm has been designed, enabling the SEM to maneuver flexibly within the confined space of the vacuum chamber to avoid collisions and prevent additional damage to the vacuum chamber. The system has integrated a Python-ROS-Unity-based algorithm for joint simulation channel development, which has been used for the virtual simulation experiments of SEM to validate the algorithms and collect data. Furthermore, a prototype has been constructed for virtual-to-real mapping experiments. Experiments show the digital twin system is feasible, with low latency, high sync, and stable operation, which verifies the feasibility of the system.},

This paper established a surrogate model of gas turbines for condition monitoring based on Markov-projection approximation subspace tracking. Furthermore, it explores the application of surrogate model in developing digital twin for gas turbines. The study initially establishes a Markov matrix and acquires an observation vector, utilizing the framework of the linear model. Utilizing real-time measurement data of gas turbine, the signal subspace of the observation vector autocorrelation matrix is updated through the projection approximation subspace tracking. By aligning this signal subspace with the generalized observability matrix, the identification results of the surrogate model parameters are obtained online. Furthermore, a variable weight projection approximation subspace tracking method has been proposed to enhance the algorithm robustness. Simulation and real experiment demonstrate that the surrogate model output effectively tracks the real-time changes in gas turbine measurement data. When faults and degradation arise, condition monitoring can be achieved by analyzing the evolution of model parameters to obtain feedback information from the gas turbine. The proposed method maintains its robustness in the presence of impulsive noise. These features offer a novel approach for the development of gas turbine digital twin.},

Technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and high-fidelity modeling and simulation have been studied to further the digitalization of the nuclear industry. In this paper, an overview of the DT initiatives and developments for the design optimization and intelligent transformation of nuclear energy systems is described to provide a development trend of DT technology for nuclear reactors. For the design of DT for complex systems such as nuclear reactors, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) technology offers requirements models, design processes, and system verification that are clearer, more precise, and more comprehensive. Four properties of Digital Twin for Nuclear Reactor System (DTNRS) are summarized, which are given by the block definition diagram of MBSE philosophy. Then, to bridge the gap between numerical models and theoretical research of DT, a systematic and hierarchical “V” architecture is proposed, which reflects the digital-related technologies of the DTNRS throughout the whole life cycle. Furthermore, a four-layered decomposition construction model is developed and a prospective application scenario of DTNRS is pictured.

The column treats 300 Nm3/h of biogas, whose inlet H2S concentration ranges from 1000 to 3000 ppm. Field measurements are conducted to investigate the H2S removal efficiency. An experimental dataset is collected, processed and used as input on Aspen PLUS suite to develop the digital twin. This model is helpful to generate a large dataset and simulate operating conditions different from the demo-scale plant. The process simulation is then exploited to perform a sensitivity analysis to figure out main variables influencing the H2S removal efficiency. Operating conditions such as H2S concentration, soda concentration and flowrate, temperature, and freshwater flowrate are perturbed in the sensitivity analysis. NaOH flowrate and its concentration are the variables with the biggest impact on the process. In detail, the highest efficiency performance was obtained using 50% NaOH solution with a flowrate higher than 8 kg/h.},

Optimization is achieved through a gradient descent algorithm, and the self-healing model is implemented using a logistic regression algorithm.

  abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) have attracted widespread attention in academia and industry in recent years. It can accurately reflect the physical world in real-time, enabling online monitoring, control, and prediction operations. Their foundation is super-real-time computing and high data representation capabilities. However, current DTs do not achieve 3D super-real-time computing. This study proposes a novel 3D computational method for solving fluid–solid coupling problems in a super-real-time. The method is based on a mixed solution framework that combines traditional numerical methods with deep learning operators. Specifically, the method employs multi-core CPU parallel acceleration to solve the solid equations while leveraging the computing power of GPU to solve the fluid equations. The fluid–solid coupling is achieved through information exchange between the GPU and the multi-core CPU. In addition, the proposed method introduces a new deep learning operator framework based on the DeepONET. The framework is accompanied by a database structure that facilitates model training and validation and a loss function that guides the training. The space nuclear reactor, an improved TOPAZ-II system, was selected to demonstrate its feasibility. Four non-training transient conditions were simulated to test the generalization performance. The results show that the proposed method achieves an average error between the calculated results and reference values below 2.5%, with the average error of thermodynamic parameters below 1.5%. The average deviation between system parameter peak values during the transient process and the reference value was less than 5 s. The result meets the acceptable error level and satisfies the super-real-time requirements with a time acceleration ratio of approximately 1.17, which is 60 times faster than traditional numerical methods. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for DT.},
