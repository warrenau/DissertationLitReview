  abstract  = {Though often overlooked, the impact of seismic transient ground deformation on natural gas (NG) pipes can be highly adverse. Particularly, pipe elbows may undergo excessive in-plane bending demand and buckling. In this paper, a critical scenario of a pipe coupling two industrial structures typically found in an NG processing plant is studied. High strain and cross-sectional ovalization on the elbows are probable during an earthquake due to the out-of-phase oscillation of the two structures imposing asynchronous displacement demands at the two pipe ends. A parametric study was first performed to investigate various structure-pipe-structure configurations that increase seismic demands to pipe elbows. Simultaneous mobilization of divergent oscillation between two supporting structures at the low-frequency range, a lower pipe-structure stiffness ratio, a shorter length of straight pipe segments in the linking pipe element, and a higher pipe internal pressure have led to the onset of critical strain demands in pipe elbows. To validate this observation, an experimental campaign was developed in which a full-scale linking pipe element was physically tested by means of hybrid simulation (HS). The study shows that the seismic interaction of the structures coupled with the pipe is nonnegligible and can even be critical for the integrity of the coupling pipe. The finding depends on the structural system's dynamic and geometrical properties as well the frequency content of the earthquake excitation.},

Therefore, this panel paper aims to explore the concept of HS and its progression through the years. In doing so, we hope to lay out the underpinnings of a structured HS approach by providing historical narratives of the origins of hybrid models; the current challenges expressed by scholars; and future studies to ensure more focused development of a comprehensive methodology for HS.},

  abstract  = {Hybrid simulation combines numerical simulation and physical testing, and is thus considered to be an efficient alternative to traditional testing methodologies in the evaluation of global performance of large or complex structures. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is performed when it is important to fully capture rate-dependent behaviors in the physical substructure. Although the demand to test more complex systems grows, not every laboratory has the right combination of computational and equipment resources available to perform largescale experiments. Distributed real-time hybrid simulation (dRTHS) facilitates testing that is to be conducted at multiple geographically distributed laboratories while utilizing the Internet to couple the substructures. One major challenge in dRTHS is to accommodate the unpredictable communication time delays between the various distributed sites that occur as a result of Internet congestion. Herein, a dRTHS framework is proposed where a modified Smith predictor is adopted to accommodate such communication delays. To examine and demonstrate the sensitivity of the proposed framework to communication delays and to modeling errors, parametric analytical case studies are presented. Additionally, the effectiveness of this dRTHS framework is verified through successful execution of multisite experiments. The results demonstrate that this framework provides a new option for researchers to evaluate the global response of structural systems in a distributed real-time environment.},

The implementation of the thermomechanical method at the ETH ZÃ¼rich IBK Structural Testing Laboratory was verified and validated using a simple two-element hybrid model. The responses of the model to a force ramp, applied to the full structure, and a scaled version of the ISO 834 standard fire curve, applied to the experimental element, were obtained in two simulations-one conducted using an explicit and the other using an implicit integration scheme. The tests yield very similar results, and both simulations closely match the theoretical solution.},

The stability, overshoot, and numerical damping characteristics of the proposed algorithms are studied. It is shown that certain algorithms have unconditional stability for linear and softening nonlinear structures. The overshoot phenomenon is small, where the displacement is one power of the time step due to the initial velocity, whereas the velocity does not. The amount of numerical damping is adjusted by a single parameter to control the divergence of false higher-order modes. The analysis of RTHS was performed on a multiple degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structure and complex buildingdamper structure to verify the theoretical analysis. The comparison with two typical algorithms of the explicit Newmark and Gui-λ demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in improving stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, which can be applied to complex RTHS.},

  abstract  = {Substructure hybrid simulation is a powerful, cost-effective alternative for testing structural systems, closely coupling numerical simulation and experimental testing to obtain the complete response of a structure. In this approach, well-understood components of the structure are modeled numerically, while the components of interest are tested physically. Generally, an arbitrary amount of time may be used to calculate and apply displacements at each step of the hybrid simulation. However, when the rate-dependent behavior of the physical specimen is important, real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) must be used. Computation, communication, and servohydraulic actuator limitations cause delays and lags that lead to inaccuracies and potential instabilities in RTHS. This paper proposes a new model-based servohydraulic tracking control method including feedforward-feedback links to achieve accurate tracking of a desired displacement in real time. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through RTHS for a single-degree-of-freedom system and a 9-story steel building, each using a 200-kN large-scale magnetorheological damper as the rate-dependent physical specimen.},

During such a test, the displacement response of a structure to a specified dynamic excitation is numerically computed and quasi‐statically imposed on the structure, based on analytically prescribed inertia and viscous damping characteristics for the structure and the experimentally measured structural restoring forces. This paper presents the basic approach of the method, describing the numerical and experimental techniques. Based on current studies, the capabilities and limitations of the method are examined, and possible improvement methods are mentioned. In spite of certain numerical and experimental errors, recent verification tests show that the method can be as reliable and realistic as shaking table testing and that it can be readily implemented in many structural laboratories. The capabilities of the method can be further expanded to test specimens under various load and structural boundary conditions.},

combination of numerical computation and physical specimens excited by shake tables and auxiliary actuators, are presented. The structure to
be simulated is divided into one or more experimental and computational substructures. The loadings generated by the seismic excitations at
the interfaces between the experimental and computational substructures, in terms of accelerations and forces, are imposed by shake tables
and actuators in a step-by-step manner at a real-time rate. The measured displacement and velocity responses of the experimental substructure
are fed back to determine the loading commands of the next time step. The unique aspect of the aforementioned hybrid simulation method
is the versatile implementation of inertia forces and a force-based substructuring. The general formulation of RTHS enables this hybrid
simulation method being executed as real-time pseudodynamic (PSD) testing, dynamic testing, and a combination of both, depending
on the availability of the laboratory testing equipment and their capacity. The derivation of the general formulation and the corresponding
testing system are presented in this paper. Numerical simulation and physical experiment were conducted on the RTHS of a three-story
structural model. Simulation and experimental results verify the concept of the proposed general formulation of RTHS and the feasibility
