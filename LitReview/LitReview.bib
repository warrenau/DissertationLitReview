  abstract  = {Though often overlooked, the impact of seismic transient ground deformation on natural gas (NG) pipes can be highly adverse. Particularly, pipe elbows may undergo excessive in-plane bending demand and buckling. In this paper, a critical scenario of a pipe coupling two industrial structures typically found in an NG processing plant is studied. High strain and cross-sectional ovalization on the elbows are probable during an earthquake due to the out-of-phase oscillation of the two structures imposing asynchronous displacement demands at the two pipe ends. A parametric study was first performed to investigate various structure-pipe-structure configurations that increase seismic demands to pipe elbows. Simultaneous mobilization of divergent oscillation between two supporting structures at the low-frequency range, a lower pipe-structure stiffness ratio, a shorter length of straight pipe segments in the linking pipe element, and a higher pipe internal pressure have led to the onset of critical strain demands in pipe elbows. To validate this observation, an experimental campaign was developed in which a full-scale linking pipe element was physically tested by means of hybrid simulation (HS). The study shows that the seismic interaction of the structures coupled with the pipe is nonnegligible and can even be critical for the integrity of the coupling pipe. The finding depends on the structural system's dynamic and geometrical properties as well the frequency content of the earthquake excitation.},

  abstract  = {Hybrid simulation combines numerical simulation and physical testing, and is thus considered to be an efficient alternative to traditional testing methodologies in the evaluation of global performance of large or complex structures. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is performed when it is important to fully capture rate-dependent behaviors in the physical substructure. Although the demand to test more complex systems grows, not every laboratory has the right combination of computational and equipment resources available to perform largescale experiments. Distributed real-time hybrid simulation (dRTHS) facilitates testing that is to be conducted at multiple geographically distributed laboratories while utilizing the Internet to couple the substructures. One major challenge in dRTHS is to accommodate the unpredictable communication time delays between the various distributed sites that occur as a result of Internet congestion. Herein, a dRTHS framework is proposed where a modified Smith predictor is adopted to accommodate such communication delays. To examine and demonstrate the sensitivity of the proposed framework to communication delays and to modeling errors, parametric analytical case studies are presented. Additionally, the effectiveness of this dRTHS framework is verified through successful execution of multisite experiments. The results demonstrate that this framework provides a new option for researchers to evaluate the global response of structural systems in a distributed real-time environment.},

The stability, overshoot, and numerical damping characteristics of the proposed algorithms are studied. It is shown that certain algorithms have unconditional stability for linear and softening nonlinear structures. The overshoot phenomenon is small, where the displacement is one power of the time step due to the initial velocity, whereas the velocity does not. The amount of numerical damping is adjusted by a single parameter to control the divergence of false higher-order modes. The analysis of RTHS was performed on a multiple degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structure and complex buildingdamper structure to verify the theoretical analysis. The comparison with two typical algorithms of the explicit Newmark and Gui-λ demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in improving stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, which can be applied to complex RTHS.},

In this approach, well-understood components of the structure are modeled numerically, while the components of interest are tested physically. Generally, an arbitrary amount of time may be used to calculate and apply displacements at each step of the hybrid simulation. However, when the rate-dependent behavior of the physical specimen is important, real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) must be used. Computation, communication, and servohydraulic actuator limitations cause delays and lags that lead to inaccuracies and potential instabilities in RTHS. This paper proposes a new model-based servohydraulic tracking control method including feedforward-feedback links to achieve accurate tracking of a desired displacement in real time. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through RTHS for a single-degree-of-freedom system and a 9-story steel building, each using a 200-kN large-scale magnetorheological damper as the rate-dependent physical specimen.},

This paper presents the basic approach of the method, describing the numerical and experimental techniques. Based on current studies, the capabilities and limitations of the method are examined, and possible improvement methods are mentioned. In spite of certain numerical and experimental errors, recent verification tests show that the method can be as reliable and realistic as shaking table testing and that it can be readily implemented in many structural laboratories. The capabilities of the method can be further expanded to test specimens under various load and structural boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Real-time dynamic substructuring is an experimental technique for testing the dynamic behaviour of complex structures. It involves creating a hybrid model of the entire structure by combining an experimental test piece—the substructure—with a numerical model describing the remainder of the system. The technique is useful when it is impractical to experimentally test the entire structure or complete numerical modelling is insufficient. In this paper, we focus on the influence of delay in the system, which is generally due to the inherent dynamics of the transfer systems (actuators) used for structural testing. This naturally gives rise to a delay differential equation (DDE) model of the substructured system. With the case of a substructured system consisting of a single mass–spring oscillator we demonstrate how a DDE model can be used to understand the influence of the response delay of the actuator. Specifically, we describe a number of methods for identifying the critical time delay above which the system becomes unstable. Because of the low damping in many large structures a typical situation is that a substructuring test would operate in an unstable region if additional techniques were not implemented in practice. We demonstrate with an adaptive delay compensation technique that the substructured mass–spring oscillator system can be stabilized successfully in an experiment. The approach of DDE modelling also allows us to determine the dependence of the critical delay on the parameters of the delay compensation scheme. Using this approach we develop an over-compensation scheme that will help ensure stable experimental testing from initiation to steady state operation. This technique is particularly suited to stiff structures or those with very low natural damping as regularly encountered in structural engineering. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Hybrid simulation results have been shown to be reliable by comparison to shake-table simulations when propagation of experimental errors is successfully mitigated. Techniques have been proposed to assess the severity of experimental errors prior to or after tests have been completed. In this paper, an error monitoring method is presented that predicts the reliability of the test results in real time using data that is readily available. Two error monitors are derived based on estimates of energy added to the hybrid simulation as a result of errors in the experimental setup. The proposed method can provide valuable decision-making information by generating early warnings of unacceptable levels of experimental errors. The warning signals can serve as an indicator to pause the simulation, examine the source of error, and correct the problem, preferably before the specimen is irreparably damaged. Use of the proposed hybrid simulation error monitors to provide a measure of confidence of the quality of the test results is verified in two hybrid simulations.},

  abstract  = {Experimental modal analysis is commonly associated with the use of simulation models for validation, correlation and model updating. However, this interaction between simulation and test is constantly evolving, not in the least because it can be applied to model-based design engineering in the broad sense. Over time, new simulation methods have emerged and consequently, new approaches combining experimental and numerical methodologies are needed and possible. Model Based System Testing (MBST) is an innovative paradigm that allows to structure this process and, in particular, to investigate how the well-established modal testing and analysis procedures and ways of working can be adopted to the multiphysical nature of mechatronic systems. As a result, many possibilities arise: test data can be used to validate multiphysical models, models help gaining insights into test conditions, hybrid approaches allow combining testing and simulation on hardware-in-the-loop and system-in-the-loop test benches, where physical systems can be combined with simulation models to apply loads and more realistic test conditions, as well as the use of data coming from feedback control system information for testing purposes. In this paper, the context and concepts of MBST will be introduced, and application examples will be shown, highlighting the advantages of such a methodology.},

  abstract = {High burn-up, rim structures within uranium dioxide (UO2) light water reactor fuels exhibit marked differences in microstructure that are attributed to dynamic recrystallization. The recrystallization process has three distinct, interacting components: damage accumulation, nucleation and growth of damage-free regions, and subsequent evolution of recrystallized grains. In this paper, microstructural-scale simulation techniques for all three processes are presented and assembled into a hybrid tool for modeling the entire dynamic recrystallization process. The components of the model include a phenomenological model for damage accumulation and nucleation, a Cellular Automaton (CA) model for the growth and impingement of recrystallized grains, and a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) Potts model for subsequent grain growth. Preliminary results of the hybrid model demonstrate the evolution of a steady state grain size. Parametric simulations show the dependence of the steady state grain size on physical variables and on system size.},

  abstract  = {Hybrid reactor simulation (HRS) of boiling water reactor (BWR) instabilities, including in-phase and out-of-phase (OOP) oscillations, has been implemented on The Pennsylvania State University TRIGA reactor. The TRIGA reactor's power response is used to simulate reactor neutron dynamics for in-phase oscillation or the fundamental mode of the reactor modal kinetics for OOP oscillations. The reactor power signal drives a real-time boiling channel simulation, and the calculated reactivity feedback is in turn fed into the TRIGA reactor via an experimental changeable reactivity device. The thermal-hydraulic dynamics, together with first harmonic mode power dynamics, is digitally simulated in the real-time environment. The real-time digital simulation of boiling channel thermal hydraulics is performed by solving constitutive equations for different regions in the channel and is realized by a high-performance personal computer. The nonlinearity of the thermal-hydraulic model ensures the capability to simulate the oscillation phenomena, limit cycle and OOP oscillation, in BWR nuclear power plants. By adjusting reactivity feedback gains for both modes, various oscillation combinations can be realized in the experiment. The dynamics of axially lumped power distribution over the core is displayed in three-dimensional graphs. The HRS reactor power response mimics the BWR core-wide power stability phenomena. In the OOP oscillation HRS, the combination of reactor response and the simulated first harmonic power using shaping functions mimics BWR regional power oscillations. With this HRS testbed, a monitoring and/or control system designed for BWR power oscillations can be experimentally tested and verified.},
