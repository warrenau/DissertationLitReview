  abstract  = {Though often overlooked, the impact of seismic transient ground deformation on natural gas (NG) pipes can be highly adverse. Particularly, pipe elbows may undergo excessive in-plane bending demand and buckling. In this paper, a critical scenario of a pipe coupling two industrial structures typically found in an NG processing plant is studied. High strain and cross-sectional ovalization on the elbows are probable during an earthquake due to the out-of-phase oscillation of the two structures imposing asynchronous displacement demands at the two pipe ends. A parametric study was first performed to investigate various structure-pipe-structure configurations that increase seismic demands to pipe elbows. Simultaneous mobilization of divergent oscillation between two supporting structures at the low-frequency range, a lower pipe-structure stiffness ratio, a shorter length of straight pipe segments in the linking pipe element, and a higher pipe internal pressure have led to the onset of critical strain demands in pipe elbows. To validate this observation, an experimental campaign was developed in which a full-scale linking pipe element was physically tested by means of hybrid simulation (HS). The study shows that the seismic interaction of the structures coupled with the pipe is nonnegligible and can even be critical for the integrity of the coupling pipe. The finding depends on the structural system's dynamic and geometrical properties as well the frequency content of the earthquake excitation.},

We provide a taxonomy that aims at giving an overview of the full spectrum of current simulation-optimization approaches. Our study may guide researchers who want to use one of the existing methods, give insights into the cross-fertilization of the ideas applied in those methods and create a standard for a better communication in the scientific community. Future reviews can use the taxonomy here described to classify both general approaches and methods for specific application fields.},

It has been argued by many researchers that Hybrid Simulation (HS) provides more and better insights into the real-life system as it allows modelers to assess its inherent problems from different dimensions. As a result HS is becoming an important field within the Modeling and Simulation arena. Yet we find that there is no clear and/or cohesive definition for it. Therefore, this panel paper aims to explore the concept of HS and its progression through the years. In doing so, we hope to lay out the underpinnings of a structured HS approach by providing historical narratives of the origins of hybrid models; the current challenges expressed by scholars; and future studies to ensure more focused development of a comprehensive methodology for HS.},

  abstract  = {Hybrid simulation combines numerical simulation and physical testing, and is thus considered to be an efficient alternative to traditional testing methodologies in the evaluation of global performance of large or complex structures. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is performed when it is important to fully capture rate-dependent behaviors in the physical substructure. Although the demand to test more complex systems grows, not every laboratory has the right combination of computational and equipment resources available to perform largescale experiments. Distributed real-time hybrid simulation (dRTHS) facilitates testing that is to be conducted at multiple geographically distributed laboratories while utilizing the Internet to couple the substructures. One major challenge in dRTHS is to accommodate the unpredictable communication time delays between the various distributed sites that occur as a result of Internet congestion. Herein, a dRTHS framework is proposed where a modified Smith predictor is adopted to accommodate such communication delays. To examine and demonstrate the sensitivity of the proposed framework to communication delays and to modeling errors, parametric analytical case studies are presented. Additionally, the effectiveness of this dRTHS framework is verified through successful execution of multisite experiments. The results demonstrate that this framework provides a new option for researchers to evaluate the global response of structural systems in a distributed real-time environment.},

  abstract  = {A new thermomechanical hybrid simulation method is proposed that extends the mechanical hybrid simulation method by including thermal degrees of freedom and temperature loads. The thermomechanical hybrid simulation method was implemented in the OpenSees and OpenFresco frameworks. Modifications to enable this new capability centered on incorporating the temperature degrees of freedom in the hybrid model domain, and on developing new OpenFresco objects and a test execution strategy to simultaneously control the structural elements of the experimental setup, the thermal loads, and the mechanical loads. The implementation of the thermomechanical method at the ETH ZÃ¼rich IBK Structural Testing Laboratory was verified and validated using a simple two-element hybrid model. The responses of the model to a force ramp, applied to the full structure, and a scaled version of the ISO 834 standard fire curve, applied to the experimental element, were obtained in two simulations-one conducted using an explicit and the other using an implicit integration scheme. The tests yield very similar results, and both simulations closely match the theoretical solution.},

  abstract  = {The paper proposes an improved single-step method of explicit displacement and velocity (SSMEDV) with controllable numerical damping based on the discrete control theory, which can be applied to real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS). The stability, overshoot, and numerical damping characteristics of the proposed algorithms are studied. It is shown that certain algorithms have unconditional stability for linear and softening nonlinear structures. The overshoot phenomenon is small, where the displacement is one power of the time step due to the initial velocity, whereas the velocity does not. The amount of numerical damping is adjusted by a single parameter to control the divergence of false higher-order modes. The analysis of RTHS was performed on a multiple degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structure and complex buildingdamper structure to verify the theoretical analysis. The comparison with two typical algorithms of the explicit Newmark and Gui-λ demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in improving stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, which can be applied to complex RTHS.},
