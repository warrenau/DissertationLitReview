**Digital twin-enabled autonomous fault mitigation in diesel engines: An experimental validation**

*Khawale et. al.*

- validation used model-in-loop (MIL) and hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulations
- paper 'focuses on creating an online fault mitigation framework for marine diesel engines' for autonomous surface vessels
- HIL code is available at: [HIL-FaultMitigation](https://github.com/Rajk-hawale/HIL-FaultMitigation)
- lots of neural network use in the models of the subsystems
- MIL testing is used for failure modes that are difficult to reproduce experimentally (fuel injector nozzle erosion/clogging and intake manifold leakage)
- validated neural network cylinder model against real data from engine
- hybrid model is validated by averaging (mean value) the operating conditions for steady state, then validated over the entire dataset to see transient response
- claims that the method can be extended to other engines with retuning of hybrid model parameters and appropriate calibration

**A Standards-Based Digital Twin of an Experiment with a Scale Modle Ship**

*Fonseca et. al.*

- as the title suggests, this work wishes to use data standards to allow models to work with varying proprietary software used in the maritime industry
